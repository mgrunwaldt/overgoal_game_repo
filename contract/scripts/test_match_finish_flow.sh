echo "📊 Step 1: Check team points BEFORE match"
echo "----------------------------------------"
echo "Team $TEAM_ID points before match:"
./scripts/query_all_teams.sh | grep -A 10 "team_id.*$TEAM_ID" | grep current_league_points

echo ""
echo "🎮 Step 2: Simulate a complete match flow"
echo "---------------------------------------"
echo "In the frontend, you should now:"
echo "1. Create a new match with team $TEAM_ID"
echo "2. Play or simulate the match until minute 90"
echo "3. Click 'Finish Match' button"
echo "4. Verify the backend finish_gamematch function is called"
echo "5. Check that team points are awarded based on match result"

echo ""
echo "🔧 Step 3: The Fix Implemented"
echo "-----------------------------"
echo "✅ Added handleFinishGameMatch() to useGameMatch hook"
echo "✅ Updated MatchComponent.tsx to call finish_gamematch for match ends"
echo "✅ Fixed both automatic (pendingMatchEvent.match_end) and manual (minute 90+) finish buttons"

echo ""
echo "📋 Step 4: Expected Behavior After Fix"
echo "-------------------------------------"
echo "When match ends at minute 90:"
echo "1. ✅ Frontend calls client.game.finishGamematch(matchId)"
echo "2. ✅ Backend finish_gamematch() function executes"
echo "3. ✅ Team points awarded: +3 for win, +1 for tie, +0 for loss"
echo "4. ✅ Frontend navigates to /match-end/[matchId]"
echo "5. ✅ When user returns to main screen, StatsPopup shows updated points"

echo ""
echo "🧪 Step 5: Manual verification"
echo "-----------------------------"
echo "After testing the fix in the UI, run this to verify points were awarded:"
echo "./scripts/query_all_teams.sh | grep -A 10 \"team_id.*$TEAM_ID\""

echo ""
echo "💡 Step 6: Debug logging to watch for"
echo "-------------------------------------"
echo "In browser console, look for these logs during match finish:"
echo "- '🏁 === FINISHING GAME MATCH ==='"
echo "- '🎮 Calling backend finish_gamematch for match [ID]'"
echo "- '✅ finish_gamematch completed - team points should be awarded'"

echo ""
echo "🎯 The Root Cause That Was Fixed"
echo "================================"
echo "❌ BEFORE: Match end → handleMatchContinuation → choseAction(0) → process_match_action → NO POINTS"
echo "✅ AFTER:  Match end → handleFinishGameMatch → finishGamematch → TEAM POINTS AWARDED!"

echo ""
echo "Ready to test! Go finish a match in the UI and see team points update! 🚀"
