# Probability Calculation Fixes & Refactoring Summary

## üêõ Critical Bugs Fixed

### 1. **Division by 100 Bug** (Major Issue)
**Location**: Open Play Shoot, Free Kick Shoot, Free Kick Cross functions
**Problem**: Probabilities were being divided by 100, making them extremely low
**Example**: 
- Before: `goal_prob = 5 * 50 / 100 = 2.5%` (way too low)
- After: `goal_prob = 500 * 50 / 100 = 250` (proper scaling in 0.1% units)

**Fixed Functions**:
- `process_open_play_shoot()` - Fixed base probability scaling
- `process_free_kick_shoot()` - Multiplied base by 10 for proper scaling
- `process_free_kick_cross()` - Multiplied base by 10 for proper scaling

### 2. **AI Always Scores Bug** (Major Issue)
**Location**: `simulate_ai_attack_outcome()` function
**Problem**: Function always returned `true` instead of calculating probabilities
**Fix**: Now properly calculates and uses goal probabilities based on action type and team stats

### 3. **Hard-coded Magic Numbers** (Code Quality Issue)
**Problem**: Probabilities scattered throughout code as magic numbers
**Solution**: Moved all base probabilities to constants at top of file

## üîß Refactoring Changes

### 1. **Game Balance Constants Section**
Added comprehensive constants section at top of `store.cairo`:

```cairo
// ===== GAME BALANCE CONSTANTS =====
// These constants control all probability calculations in the match system
// Adjust these values to fine-tune game balance

// === PENALTY PROBABILITIES ===
const PENALTY_BASE_PROBABILITY: u32 = 60; // Base penalty success rate (60%)
const PENALTY_CENTER_MODIFIER: u32 = 90; // Center penalty modifier (90% = -10%)
const PENALTY_CORNER_BASELINE_BOOST: u32 = 105; // Corner penalty boost (105% = +5%)
const PENALTY_PANENKA_BASELINE_PENALTY: u32 = 70; // Panenka penalty (70% = -30%)

// === FREE KICK PROBABILITIES ===
const FREE_KICK_BASE_PROBABILITY: u32 = 2; // Base free kick success rate (2%)
const FREE_KICK_MIN_CLAMP: u32 = 20; // Minimum free kick probability (0.2%)
const FREE_KICK_MAX_CLAMP: u32 = 600; // Maximum free kick probability (6.0%)
const FREE_KICK_SHOOT_MIN_GOAL_PROB: u32 = 50; // Min goal probability (0.5%)
const FREE_KICK_SHOOT_MAX_GOAL_PROB: u32 = 7500; // Max goal probability (75.0%)
const FREE_KICK_CROSS_MIN_GOAL_PROB: u32 = 30; // Min goal probability (0.3%)
const FREE_KICK_CROSS_MAX_GOAL_PROB: u32 = 5000; // Max goal probability (50.0%)

// === OPEN PLAY PROBABILITIES ===
const OPEN_PLAY_SHOOT_BASE_PROBABILITY: u32 = 500; // Base shoot success rate (5.0% in 0.1% units)
const OPEN_PLAY_SHOOT_MIN_GOAL_PROB: u32 = 50; // Min goal probability (0.5%)
const OPEN_PLAY_SHOOT_MAX_GOAL_PROB: u32 = 9000; // Max goal probability (90.0%)

// === MATCH EVENT PROBABILITIES ===
const MY_TEAM_ATTACK_BASE_PROBABILITY: u32 = 7; // Base attack event probability (7%)
const OPPONENT_TEAM_ATTACK_BASE_PROBABILITY: u32 = 7; // Base opponent attack probability (7%)
const RANDOM_EVENT_BASE_PROBABILITY: u32 = 1; // Base random event probability (1%)
const PENALTY_ACTION_BASE_PROBABILITY: u32 = 4; // Base penalty action probability (4%)
const FREE_KICK_ACTION_BASE_PROBABILITY: u32 = 18; // Base free kick action probability (18%)
const BRAWL_ACTION_BASE_PROBABILITY: u32 = 60; // Base brawl action probability (60%)

// === PARTICIPATION PROBABILITIES ===
const ATTACK_PARTICIPATION_BASE_PROBABILITY: u32 = 100; // Base attack participation (100%)
const DEFENSE_PARTICIPATION_BASE_PROBABILITY: u32 = 15; // Base defense participation (15%)
const SIMULATE_FOUL_PENALTY_CHANCE: u32 = 25; // Chance of penalty from simulation (25%)

// === AI ATTACK OUTCOME PROBABILITIES ===
const AI_PENALTY_SUCCESS_RATE: u32 = 80; // AI penalty success rate (80%)
const AI_FREE_KICK_SUCCESS_RATE: u32 = 10; // AI free kick success rate (10%)
const AI_OPEN_PLAY_SUCCESS_RATE: u32 = 1; // AI open play success rate (1%)
```

### 2. **Functions Updated to Use Constants**
All probability calculations now use constants instead of magic numbers:

**Penalty Functions**:
- `process_penalty_center()` - Uses `PENALTY_BASE_PROBABILITY`, `PENALTY_CENTER_MODIFIER`
- `process_penalty_corner()` - Uses `PENALTY_BASE_PROBABILITY`, `PENALTY_CORNER_BASELINE_BOOST`
- `process_penalty_panenka()` - Uses `PENALTY_BASE_PROBABILITY`, `PENALTY_PANENKA_BASELINE_PENALTY`

**Free Kick Functions**:
- `process_free_kick_shoot()` - Uses all `FREE_KICK_*` constants
- `process_free_kick_cross()` - Uses all `FREE_KICK_*` constants

**Open Play Functions**:
- `process_open_play_shoot()` - Uses all `OPEN_PLAY_SHOOT_*` constants

**Match Event Functions**:
- `check_my_team_attack_event()` - Uses `MY_TEAM_ATTACK_BASE_PROBABILITY`
- `check_opponent_team_attack_event()` - Uses `OPPONENT_TEAM_ATTACK_BASE_PROBABILITY`
- `check_random_event()` - Uses `RANDOM_EVENT_BASE_PROBABILITY`
- `determine_attack_action_type()` - Uses `PENALTY_ACTION_BASE_PROBABILITY`, `FREE_KICK_ACTION_BASE_PROBABILITY`
- `determine_random_action_type()` - Uses `BRAWL_ACTION_BASE_PROBABILITY`

**Participation Functions**:
- `check_player_attack_participation()` - Uses `ATTACK_PARTICIPATION_BASE_PROBABILITY`
- `check_player_defense_participation()` - Uses `DEFENSE_PARTICIPATION_BASE_PROBABILITY`

**AI Functions**:
- `simulate_ai_attack_outcome()` - Uses all `AI_*_SUCCESS_RATE` constants

## üéØ Benefits of This Refactoring

### 1. **Easy Game Balance Tuning**
- All probabilities are now in one place at the top of the file
- Clear documentation for each constant
- No need to hunt through code to find probability values

### 2. **Fixed Critical Bugs**
- Open play shooting should now work correctly
- Free kicks should now have proper success rates
- AI opponents will now miss shots realistically

### 3. **Better Code Maintainability**
- No more magic numbers scattered throughout code
- Constants are self-documenting with clear names
- Easy to see relationships between different probabilities

### 4. **Proper Scaling**
- Fixed division by 100 issues
- Consistent units across all calculations
- Proper probability ranges for all actions

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Open Play Shooting** - Should now have realistic success rates
2. **Test Free Kicks** - Both shoot and cross should work properly
3. **Test Penalties** - All three types should have different success rates
4. **Test AI Matches** - AI should now miss shots realistically
5. **Tune Constants** - Adjust values in constants section to balance gameplay

## üìä Expected Impact

With these fixes, you should see:
- **More realistic shooting success rates** instead of everything failing
- **Proper free kick outcomes** with occasional successes
- **Balanced AI opponent behavior** instead of constant success
- **Easy gameplay tuning** by adjusting constants

The core issue was that the probability calculations were being divided by 100, making all success rates extremely low (often less than 1%). Now they use proper scaling and should provide realistic gameplay outcomes.
