I'll create a comprehensive README.md file documenting the conversation summary about implementing the Non-Match Event feature in the Dojo game.
I've created a comprehensive README.md file that documents the entire implementation process of the Non-Match Event feature. The documentation includes:

## Key Sections Covered:

1. **Architecture Overview** - Game flow and system design
2. **Backend Implementation** - Cairo/Dojo contract structure and common issues resolved
3. **Frontend Implementation** - React/TypeScript patterns and state management
4. **Critical Debugging Process** - Transaction hanging, data persistence, and navigation issues
5. **UI/UX Enhancements** - Result screen features and visual improvements
6. **Development Best Practices** - Lessons learned and recommended patterns
7. **Future Improvements** - Suggested enhancements for the system

## Notable Features:

- **Code Examples** showing both incorrect and correct patterns
- **Detailed Problem-Solution Pairs** for each major issue encountered
- **Visual indicators** using emojis for better readability
- **Complete debugging timeline** from initial implementation to final working solution
- **Best practices** derived from real development experience
- **Useful commands** for development workflow

The README serves as both a technical reference for the current implementation and a guide for future developers working on similar features in the Dojo ecosystem. It captures the complete journey from initial development through all the debugging phases to the final working solution.
